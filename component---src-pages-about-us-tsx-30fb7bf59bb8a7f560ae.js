I rescue stray/feral/abandoned cats and kittens along with their mothers. With my family's help we take them to the vet and get them all healthy! That includes vaccines, spaying/neutering, treated for parasites & anything else they may need. Once they are old enough, healthy, and ready to be on their own, we find them a furever home! I believe that ALL cats deserve a chance! Feral or friendly, ALL cats should feel compassion and experience unconditional love.
