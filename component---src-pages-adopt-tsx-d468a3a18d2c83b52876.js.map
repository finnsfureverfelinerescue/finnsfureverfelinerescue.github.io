This is not about placing more kittens and cats. It's about the future of \r\n          the individual kittens, their habits and their happiness. Many people have been skeptical about adopting two kittens \r\n          rather than one only to thank us later for sticking to our policy. The rewards are great. We've never had anyone tell \r\n          us they wished they had only adopted one.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p><strong>Family Decision: </strong>Having a pet should be a pleasant and rewarding experience for all involved. \r\n          If you have small children, please bring them with you when you come for your adoption meet and greet. Because small \r\n          kittens are vulnerable and young children may be unable to predict the consequences of their actions, Finn's Furever Feline \r\n          Rescue takes great care in placing kittens in homes with young children. Finn's Furever Feline Rescue often has cats who \r\n          have shown themselves to be particularly tolerant of children. We will work with you to determine the best fit for your \r\n          family.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p><strong>Other Pets: </strong>We do our best to place each cat into a home where the family bond can be successful. \r\n          To that end, our adoption process includes specific advice regarding introduction to other pets. It is possible that \r\n          the cat in whom you are interested, may not be deemed an appropriate match for your furry family. If that is the case, \r\n          please understand the decision was made in the best interest of the cat and your other pets. All resident pets must be \r\n          spayed or neutered prior to an adoption from Finn's Furever Feline Rescue.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p><strong>Landlord Approval: </strong>We verify that your rental housing is pet friendly to protect your cat and you\r\n            from being evicted.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p><strong>Age/Employment: </strong>Finn's Furever Feline Rescue seeks to adopt to those who are financially secure and \r\n          in a stable living situation in order to maximize the likelihood of a lifelong bond. Older teens, newly on their own, or \r\n          still living with parents, may find themselves, in a year or two, making life changes that result in their no longer being \r\n          able to care for their pet. Because of these reasons and as our desire is to find forever homes for our cats, we only adopt \r\n          to adults 21 years and older. Additionally, as there may be, at some time, significant veterinary costs involved with any pet, \r\n          we ask that people adopt only if they have seriously evaluated the meaning of a twenty year commitment and are \r\n          financially able to bear the cost of future emergencies.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n          <p><strong>Application: </strong>Finn's Furever Feline Rescue must have an approved Adoption application filled out\r\n          and signed. We will then setup a phone interview and a meet and greet. Please take a look at our <a href=\"#adoption-process\">Adoption Process</a> for information about completing\r\n          and submitting your application.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p><strong>Indoor Only: </strong>Finn's Furever Feline Rescue adopts to indoor-only homes. This means INDOORS ALL OF \r\n          THE TIME. If letting your cat outdoors does not suit your household, please let us refer you to other organizations\r\n          which have a more tolerant contract around this restriction.</p>\r\n\r\n          <p><strong>Declawing:</strong> Cats frequently suffer long term problems after being surgically declawed, such \r\n          as aggressive and eliminating outside the litter box. Finn's Furever Feline Rescue requires that you sign a contract \r\n          agreeing that you will not have the cat's claws surgically altered in any way, including laser surgery or tendonotomy.</p>\r\n        \r\n        </div>\r\n      </main>\r\n      <Footer></Footer>\r\n    </div>\r\n  )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport const Head = () => <title>Adopt - Finn's Furever Feline Rescue</title>\r\nexport default AdoptPage"],"names":["props","React","Carousel","controls","indicators","Item","className","heroImageClass","Caption","slideLabel","slideDescription","Head","AdoptPage","Logo","Navigation","menuSelected","Hero","href","Button","variant","type","age","limit","hidebreed","status","petlisttitle","organization","apibase","petfinderurl","accesstoken","Script","src","id","Footer"],"sourceRoot":""}
